## Your Dota Doll

Your Dota doll is a static website (hosted on Github) that tells you which of your friends you should probably not be play Dota 2 with. 
The website hadles partial Steam login to obtain your SteamID and then makes a get request to [Dota Open API](
https://docs.opendota.com/) to obatin and process your matches played with peers.

**This was done just for fun!**
